# VibeTunnel Issues - Executive Summary

## Current Status
- **Service**: Running but experiencing connection issues
- **Authentication**: Broken for all users except 'vibetunnel'
- **Root Access Required**: To implement fixes

## Issue 1: Connection Refused / Sessions Closing

**What's happening**: The service becomes unreachable from the browser after a few seconds, showing ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED errors.

**Why**: The service is still running locally but stops accepting remote connections, possibly due to:
- Resource exhaustion
- Connection limits
- Event loop blocking

**Quick Fix**: Restart the service: `sudo systemctl restart vibetunnel`

## Issue 2: Multi-User Authentication

**What's happening**: Only the 'vibetunnel' user can log in. Test user authentication fails.

**Why**: The vibetunnel process lacks permission to read /etc/shadow for PAM authentication.

**Quick Fix**: `sudo usermod -a -G shadow vibetunnel && sudo systemctl restart vibetunnel`

## Immediate Action Required

Run these commands as root:

```bash
# Fix authentication
sudo usermod -a -G shadow vibetunnel

# Restart service
sudo systemctl restart vibetunnel

# Test authentication
curl -X POST http://localhost:4020/api/auth/password \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId": "testuser", "password": "************"}'
```
